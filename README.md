# Cimmino parallel algorithm
Parallel implementation of an iterative projection-type Cimmino method for solving the linear equation systems and some type of linear inequality systems on computing clusters.

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of Cimmino method for solving large-scale non-stationary systems of linear inequalities on computing clusters. The solution is built in C++ using the BSF-skeleton. The source codes of the BSF-skeleton with an user manual are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of Cimmino parallel algorithm is available in the paper [1].
